                                In our line of work, you compromise where you can. Where you can't, don't.

                                I am a Computer Engineering student at Rutgers University finding my way to a fulfilling life and career. I am
                                passionate about building relationships and learning from new experiences. I never shy away from putting in that 
                                extra effort to achieve excellence in my work. My peers have said that I'm the "voice of reason" in any group dynamic
                                by virtue of my ability to rationalize and evaluate situations. I believe my work ethic and discipline are my
                                greatest fortitude in life.

                                    <p class = "details">Check marks and people are my greatest motivators in life.
                                        I derive enthusiasm from setting and meeting goals and expectations. Working with people, either 
                                        as a leader or as part of a team, stimulates enterprise in me. My biggest thrill in life
                                        is completing a difficult project and seeing it through to the end, despite all hurdles.

                                    <p class = "details">The nature of technology to champion any and all 
                                    challenges faced by humans fascinated me to pursue a degree in computer engineering. 
                                    I thrive on resolving problems that come with a challenge,
                                    I enjoy that in engineering no solution is too grandiose, and there is always room to improve. 
                                    I could never see myself doing anything else with my life than working as an engineer. I hope to use the passion I have for 
                                    technology and problem-solving to meaningfully impact people’s lives one day, even if that is in a small capacity.</p>

                                        A weakness that I want to overcome in the near future is being over-disciplined; 
                                        in other words, I lack spontaniety at times. I'm the kind of person who works best when I'm well-prepared
                                        and know my destination; a blurred vision tends to throw me off. But given the world we are living in today, this 
                                        can be detrimental. So I'm currently trying to put myself in situations that push me to be a 
                                        bit more adaptable with my plans and drive me to think on my feet.</p>
