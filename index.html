                I am an aspiring Computer Engineering student at Rutgers University finding my way to a fulfilling life and career. I am
                passionate about building relationships and learning from new experiences. I never shy away from putting in that 
                extra effort to achieve excellence in my work. My peers have said that I'm the "voice of reason" in any group dynamic
                by virtue of my ability to rationalize and evaluate situations. I believe my work ethic and discipline are my
                greatest fortitude in life.

                        I collaborated with 5 interns to detect if social distancing was being followed by people in New York City based on dashcam and traffic image data. I worked on                                                  â€¢ Using NumPy and OpenCV to create a Python program that implements YOLO (an object detection model) for people detection and analysis of social distancing among them. 
                        building programs using OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL to filter out images based on brightness and whether they have at least 1 (one) person, and cropping out patches around the person. 
                        Processing and maintaining image directories and Python scripts on Ubuntu remote server. 
                        I also helped in designing and updating the project website weekly to establish a timeline, <a href="https://mshankar58.github.io/winlab-social-distancing-2021/about">record of progress</a>, and future goals
